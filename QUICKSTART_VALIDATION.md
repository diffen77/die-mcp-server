- [ ] `error.code` is `"INVALID_URL"`
- [ ] Error mentions localhost not allowed

**Private IP Rejection**:
```bash
# Test with URL: "http://192.168.1.1"
```

**Expected**:
- [ ] `success` is `false`
- [ ] Error code is `"INVALID_URL"`

---

### 4. Caching Test

**First Request**:
```bash
# Analyze https://example.com with React + Tailwind
```

- [ ] Record response time (should be 5-10s)
- [ ] Check cache stats: `curl http://localhost:3000/cache/stats`
- [ ] `entries` should be 1

**Second Request** (same URL + config):
```bash
# Repeat same request
```

- [ ] Response time < 1 second
- [ ] Generated code is identical to first request
- [ ] Cache stats show hit rate increased

**Different Config** (same URL):
```bash
# Analyze same URL but with Vue + CSS
```

- [ ] Creates new cache entry (different key)
- [ ] `entries` should be 2

---

### 5. Framework Variety Test

Test all combinations:

**React + Tailwind**:
- [ ] Generates `.tsx` file
- [ ] Uses `className=`
- [ ] Includes tailwindcss dependency

**React + CSS**:
- [ ] Imports `.css` file
- [ ] Includes CSS module pattern

**React + SCSS**:
- [ ] Imports `.scss` file
- [ ] Includes sass dependency

**React + styled-components**:
- [ ] Imports `styled-components`
- [ ] Uses `styled.` syntax

**Angular + CSS**:
- [ ] Generates `.component.ts` file
- [ ] Has `@Component` decorator
- [ ] Has `styleUrls` property

**Vue + SCSS**:
- [ ] Generates `.vue` file
- [ ] Has `<style lang="scss">`
- [ ] Uses SFC format

**Svelte + CSS**:
- [ ] Generates `.svelte` file
- [ ] Has `<script>` and `<style>` sections

---

## ‚úÖ Monitoring

### Cache Performance

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/cache/stats
```

**Expected**:
- [ ] Returns cache statistics
- [ ] `size` ‚â§ `maxSize` (1GB)
- [ ] `hitRate` increases with cache hits
- [ ] `entries` and `evictions` are tracked

### Logs

```bash
docker logs die-server -f
```

**Expected**:
- [ ] Structured logging with timestamps
- [ ] INFO level messages for normal operations
- [ ] No ERROR messages during successful analysis
- [ ] Request/response logging visible

```bash
docker logs ollama -f
```

**Expected**:
- [ ] Model loading messages
- [ ] No errors during model inference
- [ ] Response times logged

---

## ‚úÖ Common Issues Resolution

### Models Not Loading

**Test**:
```bash
docker exec ollama ollama list
```

**Expected**:
- [ ] Shows `llava:7b` in list
- [ ] Shows `codellama:13b` in list

**If missing, manually pull**:
```bash
docker exec ollama ollama pull llava:7b
docker exec ollama ollama pull codellama:13b
```

### Timeout Errors

**Causes**:
- [ ] Page has >500 DOM elements
- [ ] Network connectivity issues
- [ ] Page takes >30s to load

**Resolution**:
- [ ] Verify page is accessible
- [ ] Check DOM element count in error details
- [ ] Try simpler page

### Out of Memory

**Check**:
```bash
docker stats
```

**Expected**:
- [ ] DIE server uses < 2GB
- [ ] Ollama uses < 4GB
- [ ] Total system memory sufficient

**Resolution**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/cache/clear
```

- [ ] Cache cleared successfully
- [ ] Memory usage decreased

      "args": ["exec", "-i", "die-server", "node", "/app/dist/mcp/server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Expected**:
- [ ] Configuration accepted
- [ ] MCP server shows as connected in Claude

**Expected**:
- [ ] Claude calls the tool successfully
- [ ] Returns generated component code
- [ ] Code is formatted and readable
