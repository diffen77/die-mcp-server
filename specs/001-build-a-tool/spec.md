# Feature Specification: Webpage to Component Analyzer

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-a-tool`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a tool that analyzes any complete webpage and generates production-ready component code. Users provide a website URL and specify their preferred framework (React, Angular, Vue, or Svelte) and styling approach (Tailwind, CSS, SCSS, or styled-components). The system captures the entire page visually, extracts the design structure including colors, typography, layout patterns, and semantic HTML structure, then generates a complete, self-contained component that recreates the page design. The generated code must be ready to use immediately without placeholders, include all necessary imports and types, follow framework-specific best practices, be fully responsive with mobile-first design, and include accessibility features. The analysis must complete within 30 seconds for typical pages and work completely offline after initial setup."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: For the 30-second performance requirement, what should define a "typical" webpage? ‚Üí A: < 500 DOM elements and < 10MB total resources
- Q: When the webpage contains iframes, embedded videos, or third-party widgets, how should the system handle them? ‚Üí A: Extract and recreate visual appearance only
- Q: For pages with heavy JavaScript that dynamically render content, when should the analysis capture occur? ‚Üí A: Immediately on page load (HTML only)
- Q: Should the system generate one monolithic component for the entire page or break it into subcomponents? ‚Üí A: Single monolithic component only
- Q: When the webpage uses custom fonts that are not available locally, what should the system do? ‚Üí A: Map to closest available system fonts

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer wants to recreate the visual design of an existing webpage as a reusable component in their application. They provide the webpage URL, select their framework and styling approach, and receive immediately usable component code that accurately recreates the page's design, layout, and structure. The generated component works responsively across devices and includes proper accessibility features, ready to integrate into their project without modifications.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a valid webpage URL, **When** the user specifies React with Tailwind CSS, **Then** the system generates a complete React component with Tailwind classes that visually recreates the page design
2. **Given** a complex webpage with multiple sections, **When** analysis completes, **Then** the generated component includes all identified colors, typography, spacing, and layout patterns
3. **Given** a simple landing page, **When** the user requests Vue with SCSS, **Then** the system delivers a self-contained Vue component with SCSS styles and all necessary imports
4. **Given** any generated component, **When** viewed on mobile and desktop, **Then** the component responds appropriately following mobile-first design principles
5. **Given** a typical webpage (under standard complexity), **When** analysis begins, **Then** the complete component code is generated within 30 seconds
6. **Given** the tool is set up, **When** used without internet connection, **Then** the analysis and generation process completes successfully for any accessible webpage

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the URL is invalid or unreachable? ‚Üí Returns INVALID_URL or UNREACHABLE_URL error code
- What happens when the webpage is too large or complex to analyze within 30 seconds? ‚Üí Returns TIMEOUT or DOM_TOO_LARGE error
- How does the system handle webpages with dynamic content or heavy JavaScript interactions?
- What happens when the webpage uses custom fonts not available locally?
- How does the system handle responsive breakpoints that differ from standard mobile-first patterns?
- What happens when the webpage contains iframes, embedded videos, or third-party widgets?
- How does the system extract colors from images, gradients, or CSS variables?
- What happens when semantic HTML structure is unclear or malformed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
