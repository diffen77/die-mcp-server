# Feature Specification: Webpage Component Extractor

**Feature Branch**: `002-build-a-tool`
**Created**: 2025-10-01
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a tool that extracts and recreates individual components from any webpage. Users provide a website URL, identify the specific component they want either by CSS selector or by describing it semantically (like "navigation bar" or "pricing table"), and specify their target framework and styling preference. The system locates the component on the page, captures it visually in isolation, analyzes its design including interactive states like hover and focus effects, and generates standalone component code. When multiple matching components exist, the system presents all options for the user to choose from. When a component cannot be found, the system suggests similar elements that were detected. The generated component must be self-contained, production-ready, and include proper event handlers for any interactive elements."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-01
- Q: Which frameworks should the tool support for code generation? ‚Üí A: React and Vue only (most popular)
- Q: What styling formats should be supported for the generated components? ‚Üí A: CSS, SCSS/Sass, and CSS-in-JS
- Q: What should be the maximum timeout for loading and rendering webpages? ‚Üí A: User-configurable with 30s default
- Q: How should the tool handle CSS styles inherited from parent elements? ‚Üí A: Let user choose between computed or original styles
- Q: How should the tool handle pages that require authentication? ‚Üí A: Skip authentication-required pages with error message

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a web developer or designer, I want to extract specific components from any webpage and recreate them in my preferred framework and styling approach, so that I can quickly reuse and adapt existing UI patterns without manually rebuilding them from scratch.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user provides a valid webpage URL and a CSS selector for a component, **When** the tool processes the page, **Then** it extracts the specified component and generates standalone code in the user's chosen framework
2. **Given** a user provides a webpage URL and describes a component semantically (e.g., "navigation bar"), **When** the tool searches for matching elements, **Then** it identifies and presents the most likely candidates for user selection
3. **Given** multiple components match the user's criteria, **When** the tool finds these matches, **Then** it presents all options with visual previews for the user to choose from
4. **Given** a component has interactive states (hover, focus, active), **When** the tool analyzes the component, **Then** it captures and recreates all these states in the generated code
5. **Given** no exact match is found for the user's component request, **When** the search completes, **Then** the tool suggests similar elements that were detected on the page

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the webpage URL is invalid or unreachable?
- How does system handle components that rely on external resources (fonts, images, icons)?
- When page requires authentication: System returns error message and skips the page
- How does the tool handle dynamically loaded content (AJAX, lazy loading)?
- What happens when components have complex dependencies on parent containers?
- How does the system handle components with animations or transitions?
- When user specifies unsupported framework: System returns error listing supported frameworks (React, Vue)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept a valid webpage URL as input from the user
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to identify components either by CSS selector or semantic description
- **FR-003**: System MUST capture visual representation of the identified component in isolation
- **FR-004**: System MUST analyze and detect interactive states including hover, focus, and active effects
- **FR-005**: Users MUST be able to specify their target framework for code generation
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to specify their styling preference from CSS, SCSS/Sass, or CSS-in-JS formats
- **FR-007**: System MUST present all matching components when multiple matches exist, allowing user selection
- **FR-008**: System MUST suggest similar elements when exact match cannot be found
- **FR-009**: Generated component code MUST be self-contained and production-ready
- **FR-010**: System MUST include proper event handlers for interactive elements in generated code
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle webpage loading and rendering with user-configurable timeout (default 30 seconds)
- **FR-012**: System MUST isolate the component visually from the rest of the page
- **FR-013**: System MUST support React and Vue frameworks for component code generation
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle error cases gracefully including invalid URLs, network timeouts, and authentication-required pages
- **FR-016**: System MUST skip authentication-required pages and return clear error message to user
- **FR-015**: System MUST allow users to choose between computed styles or original styles when extracting components

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Webpage**: The source page containing components to extract (URL, content, loading state)
- **Component**: A UI element identified for extraction (selector, semantic description, visual representation, interactive states)
- **Framework Target**: The user's chosen output format (framework type, version requirements)
- **Styling Preference**: The user's chosen styling approach (methodology, format)
- **Component Match**: A potential component that matches user criteria (element reference, confidence score, preview)
- **Generated Code**: The final output (source code, dependencies, event handlers, styles)
